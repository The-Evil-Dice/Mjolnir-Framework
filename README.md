# Mjolnir-Framework
A framework created using PHP, XML and currently bootstrap to allow the faster creation of webapps.

Eventually this will be a framework that allows users to quickly create online systems by simply dropping PHP, HTML, JS, etc. segments into the elements folder, and telling the framework which pages they want that segment to appear on in an XML file, detailing pages and their contents.
